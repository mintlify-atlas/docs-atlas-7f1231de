The Beaver Builder REST API returns responses in different formats depending on the endpoint you're calling. All responses follow the WordPress REST API standards and return JSON data.

## Content Endpoint Response

The content endpoint (`/fl-builder/v1/{id}`) returns a comprehensive object containing the rendered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a Beaver Builder layout.

### Response Structure

<ResponseField name="id" type="integer" required>
  The post ID of the requested Beaver Builder layout.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="html" type="string" required>
  The fully rendered HTML content of the Beaver Builder layout. This includes all modules, rows, and columns with their configured settings applied.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="css" type="string" required>
  The compiled CSS styles for the layout. This includes all module styles, responsive settings, and custom CSS. Whitespace is preserved in this response.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="js" type="string" required>
  The JavaScript code required for the layout's interactive elements. This includes module scripts and any custom JavaScript. Whitespace is preserved in this response.
</ResponseField>

### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "html": "<div class='fl-builder-content'>...</div>",
  "css": ".fl-node-abc123 { background-color: #fff; }",
  "js": "jQuery(document).ready(function($) { ... });"
}
```

<Note>
The `html`, `css`, and `js` fields work together to provide a complete, ready-to-render Beaver Builder layout. You typically need all three to properly display the content.
</Note>

## CSS Endpoint Response

The CSS endpoint (`/fl-builder/v1/css/{id}`) returns only the compiled CSS for a specific layout.

### Response Structure

Returns a plain string containing the minified CSS with all spaces, newlines, and tabs removed.

<ResponseField name="response" type="string" required>
  Minified CSS string with all whitespace characters (spaces, newlines, tabs) stripped out for optimal delivery size.
</ResponseField>

### Example Response

```css
.fl-node-abc123{background-color:#fff;padding:20px;}.fl-node-def456{color:#333;font-size:16px;}
```

<Tip>
The CSS endpoint is useful when you only need to update styles without re-fetching the entire layout. This can improve performance for dynamic style updates.
</Tip>

## JS Endpoint Response

The JavaScript endpoint (`/fl-builder/v1/js/{id}`) returns only the JavaScript code for a specific layout.

### Response Structure

Returns a plain string containing the minified JavaScript with all spaces, newlines, and tabs removed.

<ResponseField name="response" type="string" required>
  Minified JavaScript string with all whitespace characters (spaces, newlines, tabs) stripped out for optimal delivery size.
</ResponseField>

### Example Response

```javascript
jQuery(document).ready(function($){$('.fl-node-abc123').fadeIn();});
```

<Tip>
Use the JS endpoint when you need to dynamically load or update JavaScript functionality without re-fetching the entire layout content.
</Tip>

## Response Headers

All endpoints return standard WordPress REST API headers:

- `Content-Type: application/json` (for content endpoint)
- `Content-Type: text/plain` (for CSS and JS endpoints)
- `X-WP-Total`: Total number of items (when applicable)
- `X-WP-TotalPages`: Total number of pages (when applicable)

<Warning>
The CSS and JS endpoints return plain text strings, not JSON objects. Make sure your client handles these responses appropriately.
</Warning>

## Data Processing

### Content Endpoint

The content endpoint processes data through the following pipeline:

1. Retrieves the post by ID using `get_post()`
2. Renders the layout content using `FLBuilder::render_content_by_id()`
3. Generates the CSS using `FLBuilder::render_css()`
4. Generates the JavaScript using `FLBuilder::render_js()`
5. Returns all components as a structured object

### CSS and JS Endpoints

Both endpoints apply whitespace stripping for optimization:

- Removes all newline characters (`\n`)
- Removes all carriage returns (`\r`)
- Removes all tabs (`\t`)
- Removes all spaces

This results in smaller payload sizes for faster delivery.

  <Card title="Use the Right Endpoint" icon="bullseye">
    Use the content endpoint for initial loads, and the CSS/JS endpoints for dynamic updates.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Cache Responses" icon="database">
    Cache responses when possible to reduce server load and improve performance.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Handle All Components" icon="puzzle-piece">
    When using the content endpoint, ensure you inject the HTML, CSS, and JS in the correct order.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Verify Post ID" icon="check">
    Always verify the post ID exists and is a valid Beaver Builder layout before making requests.
